## 👨‍💻 About Me  

Hello! I’m **Sumant Deshmukh**, a curious and passionate learner currently pursuing my **B.Tech. in Electronics and Computer Science** at  
**Padmabhooshan Vasantraodada Patil Institute of Technology**.  

From the very beginning of my academic journey, I have been fascinated by the world of **technology and security**. My curiosity about how systems work — and more importantly, how they can be protected — naturally led me to the field of **Cybersecurity**. Over time, I have developed a strong interest in **Digital Forensics** and **Incident Response (DFIR)**, where I enjoy exploring how evidence is uncovered, analyzed, and used to safeguard systems against threats.  

Currently, I am interning at **Acmegrade**, where I am getting the opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios. This hands-on exposure is helping me build practical skills, sharpen my analytical mindset, and understand industry best practices in the security domain.  

I recently had the opportunity to participate in a **hackathon organized by The Product Space**, which gave me valuable experience in collaborative problem-solving, rapid prototyping, and thinking outside the box under time pressure. These experiences fuel my excitement to constantly keep learning, adapting, and growing in this fast-paced digital landscape.  

Beyond academics, I am someone who thrives on **continuous learning** and believes in sharing knowledge with others. I enjoy diving deep into emerging technologies, writing technical blogs, and building projects that challenge my creativity and problem-solving abilities. My long-term vision is to contribute meaningfully to the field of cybersecurity, specializing in **threat detection, digital forensics, and security research**, while also mentoring others who want to step into this domain.
